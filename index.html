            <h1>About Program</h1>
            <p><mark>2 Years Diploma (Program Code: 11701)</mark></p>
            <p>Humber's award-winning <strong>Multimedia Design and Development diploma program</strong> offers the opportunity to participate in an extensive multimedia design education where you’ll build a range of interactive digital media production skills including web design, mobile interface design, experience design, motion graphics, 2D animation, web coding, streaming, user testing, video and sound editing, user interface prototyping, digital storytelling, and interactive design. Through this hands-on learning process, you will develop the fundamental creative and technical multimedia design and development capabilities needed to pursue employment in videography, motion graphics, web design and interactive content development.</p>
            <p><strong>Multimedia Design and Development</strong> is one of the three programs within our interaction and design common platform cluster. The first semester of this program is shared with the three-year Web Design and Interactive Media program, and the three-year Graphic Design program. This offers you exposure to the different areas of programming, common elements of design and creative thinking, and collaborative work with students studying to work in complementary career fields. Greater exposure to the ever-evolving exciting world of design and development will allow you to investigate the edges of this area of study, and then you will confirm your focus prior to your second semester of study.</p>
            <p>Under the guidance of experienced and knowledgeable professors, you’ll learn on and become experienced with industry-standard software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Adobe Brackets, Illustrator, After Effects, Audition, Adobe Animate, Final Cut Pro and Premiere. Web technologies such as HTML5, Extensible Markup Language (XML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3), JavaScript, jQuery and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) and MySQL are employed in hands-on learning situations in our applied teaching environment with relevant industry projects.</p>
            <p>You will cultivate important collaborative teamwork and project management skills through group assignments both within this program, and through interdisciplinary work with students in sister programs. This will prepare you for collaborative projects in the field and help you gain real-world perspective on the nature of multimedia work. You will be prepared to pursue new media opportunities by developing a comprehensive portfolio that you can present to potential employers or clients, and have exposure to the entrepreneurial opportunities open to professionals in this rich field. Students in this program will also build real-world user experience skills through the use of our unique, state-of-the-art mobile usability lab and through a work placement.</p>
